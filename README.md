  <h1>🚗 Boston Valet Worklog</h1>

  <p><strong>Boston Valet Worklog</strong> is a web-based solution designed to digitize and streamline manual work log entry processes for valet employees and administrators.</p>

  <h2>💡 Project Inspiration</h2>
  <p>This idea originated when I noticed a local company struggling with <strong>manual data entry</strong>, where employees were writing down their daily work information on paper, and managers would later transfer it into Excel spreadsheets — a time-consuming and error-prone process.</p>

  <p>To solve this, I built a modern web application that replaces the manual process with an intuitive, efficient, and secure digital platform.</p>

  <h2>🧠 Key Features</h2>

  <h3>👥 User Roles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Can create and manage employee accounts, view logs, edit users and workplaces, and analyze data.</li>
    <li><strong>Employee:</strong> Can sign in and log their daily work activity and hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📋 Core Functionality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Employee worklog submissions are stored in a centralized database.</li>
    <li>Admin dashboard with:
      <ul>
        <li>Overview of all employees</li>
        <li>Access to individual work logs</li>
        <li>Edit/remove users and work locations</li>
        <li>Data tables sorted by <strong>year</strong> and <strong>weeks</strong> for easy filtering</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Responsive and user-friendly interface</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🛠️ Tech Stack</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React</li>
    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express</li>
    <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong>JWT</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔍 How It Works</h2>

    <li>Employees log in and enter daily work information (time, location, tasks, etc.)</li>
    <li>Admins view submissions from all employees in a sortable, filterable dashboard</li>
    <li>Admins can generate reports by year and weekly breakdowns</li>
  </ol>
